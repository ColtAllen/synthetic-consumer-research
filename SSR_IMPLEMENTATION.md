# SSR Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of **Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR)** methodology as described in the paper "LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings" (Maier et al., 2025).

## What Changed

### Problem Addressed

The previous implementation directly extracted Likert-scale numeric ratings from LLM responses (e.g., `interest_score: int`), which the paper explicitly advises against. This approach loses information and doesn't properly model the uncertainty inherent in LLM responses.

### Solution: SSR Methodology

SSR converts natural language responses into **probability distributions** over Likert scales using semantic similarity. Instead of forcing a single numeric rating, SSR:

1. Captures natural language responses from personas
2. Uses semantic embeddings to measure similarity with reference statements
3. Converts similarities into probability mass functions (PMFs)
4. Aggregates PMFs to calculate market fit metrics

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated `PersonaResponse` Model (`src/utils/models.py`)

**Before:**
```python
class PersonaResponse(BaseModel):
    persona_name: str
    interest_score: int  # Direct Likert score 1-5
    disappointment: DisappointmentLevel  # Enum: VERY/SOMEWHAT/NOT
    likelihood_to_recommend: int  # Direct NPS score 0-10
    # ...
```

**After:**
```python
class PersonaResponse(BaseModel):
    persona_name: str
    interest_response: str  # Natural language response
    disappointment_response: str  # Natural language response
    recommendation_response: str  # Natural language response
    # ...
```

### 2. Updated Prompts (`config/prompts.yaml`)

**Before:** Asked for numeric ratings:
```yaml
"interest_score": <number 1-5>
"disappointment": "<VERY or SOMEWHAT or NOT>"
"likelihood_to_recommend": <number 0-10>
```

**After:** Asks for natural language:
```yaml
"interest_response": "<your natural language response>"
"disappointment_response": "<your natural language response>"
"recommendation_response": "<your natural language response>"
```

Prompt instructs: "Express your opinions naturally and conversationally. Don't use numbers or scales."

### 3. Refactored Market Predictor (`src/agents/market_predictor.py`)

#### Added SSR Initialization

```python
def _initialize_ssr_raters(self):
    """Initialize SSR ResponseRater objects for each rating dimension."""
    # Define reference sentences for each Likert scale point
    interest_references = po.DataFrame({
        "id": ["interest"] * 5,
        "int_response": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        "sentence": [
            "Not interested at all",
            "Slightly interested",
            "Moderately interested",
            "Very interested",
            "Extremely interested"
        ]
    })
    
    # Initialize ResponseRater for text-to-PMF conversion
    self.interest_rater = ResponseRater(interest_references)
    # Similar for disappointment and recommendation...
```

#### Refactored PMF Calculation

**Before:** Direct counting of numeric ratings:
```python
very_disappointed = sum(1 for r in responses if r.is_very_disappointed())
pmf_score = (very_disappointed / total) * 100
avg_interest = statistics.mean(r.interest_score for r in responses)
```

**After:** SSR-based PMF aggregation:
```python
# Convert natural language to PMFs using SSR
interest_pmfs = self.interest_rater.get_response_pmfs(
    "interest", [r.interest_response for r in responses], 
    temperature=1.0, epsilon=0.01
)

# Calculate expected values from PMFs
interest_scores = np.array([np.dot(pmf, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) for pmf in interest_pmfs])
avg_interest = float(np.mean(interest_scores))

# Calculate PMF score using probability distributions
very_disappointed_probs = disappointment_pmfs[:, 3:5].sum(axis=1)
pmf_score = float(np.mean(very_disappointed_probs) * 100)
```

### 4. Updated Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)

Added required packages:
```toml
"numpy>=1.24.0",
"polars>=0.20.0",
"scipy>=1.10.0",
"sentence-transformers>=2.2.0",
"semantic-similarity-rating @ git+https://github.com/pymc-labs/semantic-similarity-rating.git",
```

### 5. Updated Tests

**test_models.py:**
- Removed tests for `is_very_disappointed()`, `is_promoter()`, `is_detractor()` (no longer exist)
- Added tests for natural language response fields

**test_pmf_calculation.py:**
- Updated to create responses with natural language instead of numeric ratings
- Tests now verify language patterns rather than exact numeric values
- Example:
  ```python
  # Before: assert response.interest_score == 5
  # After: assert "extremely" in response.interest_response.lower()
  ```

## Key Benefits

1. **Follows Paper's Methodology:** Implements the exact approach recommended in the paper
2. **Preserves Uncertainty:** PMFs capture distribution of possible ratings instead of single value
3. **More Realistic:** Natural language responses are closer to real survey behavior
4. **Statistically Rigorous:** Uses semantic embeddings and probability theory

## Update: Corrected SSR Implementation (v2)

**Date:** October 17, 2025

### Critical Fixes Applied

The initial implementation had a fundamental misunderstanding of how to use SSR PMFs. The following corrections were made:

#### ❌ Previous (Incorrect) Approach:
```python
# WRONG: Summing PMFs to get "counts"
interest_dist_array = interest_pmfs.sum(axis=0)
interest_dist = {i+1: int(round(interest_dist_array[i])) for i in range(5)}

# WRONG: Converting back to discrete scores and applying thresholds
interest_scores = np.array([np.dot(pmf, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) for pmf in interest_pmfs])
enthusiasts = sum(1 for score in interest_scores if score >= 4.0)
```

This defeated the purpose of SSR by:
1. Converting probability distributions back to discrete counts
2. Losing all uncertainty information
3. Applying hard thresholds to expected values

#### ✅ Corrected (SSR-Compliant) Approach:
```python
# CORRECT: Average PMFs to get survey-level probability distribution
survey_interest_pmf = interest_pmfs.mean(axis=0)  # [p1, p2, p3, p4, p5]
survey_disappointment_pmf = disappointment_pmfs.mean(axis=0)

# CORRECT: Calculate metrics from aggregated PMF
avg_interest = np.dot(survey_interest_pmf, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
pmf_score = (survey_disappointment_pmf[3] + survey_disappointment_pmf[4]) * 100

# CORRECT: Report probabilities, not counts
enthusiasts_pct = (survey_interest_pmf[3] + survey_interest_pmf[4]) * 100
interest_distribution = {i+1: float(survey_interest_pmf[i]) for i in range(5)}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **PMF Aggregation**: Now correctly uses `.mean(axis=0)` to get survey-level PMF
2. **Probability-Based Metrics**: All segmentation metrics now work with probabilities
3. **Interest Distribution**: Now reports probability distribution (0-1) instead of counts
4. **Superfan Calculation**: Uses joint probability `P(interest=5) * P(disappointment≥4)`
5. **Removed Hard Thresholds**: No longer converts expected values to discrete bins

### Mathematical Correctness:

Following the SSR paper:
- **Survey PMF**: `μ = (1/N) Σ PMF_i` (average of individual PMFs)
- **Expected Value**: `E[X] = Σ x_i * P(x_i)`
- **Probability of Event**: `P(X ≥ k) = Σ_{i≥k} P(x_i)`

This preserves the probabilistic nature of LLM responses throughout the entire pipeline.

## Update: Enhanced SSR Implementation (v3)

**Date:** October 17, 2025

### Improvements Aligned with Paper Recommendations

Based on careful analysis of [Maier et al. (2025) - arXiv:2510.08338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08338), the following enhancements were made to fully align with the paper's methodology:

#### 1. **Multiple Reference Sets**
Now uses **3 different phrasings per Likert level**, averaged using the `"mean"` parameter:

**Example - Purchase Intent:**
- Set 1 (Direct): "I definitely would not purchase this" ... "I definitely would purchase this"
- Set 2 (Probability): "There is no chance I would buy this" ... "I would almost certainly buy this"
- Set 3 (Behavioral): "I would never consider buying this" ... "I would always consider buying this"

The SSR algorithm averages across all three sets to reduce bias from any single phrasing choice.

#### 2. **Larger Embedding Model**
Upgraded from `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (22M params) to `all-mpnet-base-v2` (110M params) for:
- Better semantic understanding
- More nuanced similarity detection
- Improved reliability (paper emphasizes model choice matters)

#### 3. **Psychometrically Sound Phrasing**
Reference statements now use validated consumer research language:
- **Interest**: Appeal-based, relevance-based, and intensity-based phrasings
- **Purchase Intent**: Direct likelihood, probability, and behavioral intent
- **Disappointment**: Direct emotion, impact assessment, and loss reaction
- **Recommendation**: Direct recommendation, advocacy level, and word-of-mouth

#### 4. **Configurable SSR Parameters**
Temperature and epsilon are now configurable in `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
ssr:
  embedding_model: "all-mpnet-base-v2"
  temperature: 1.0  # Lower = sharper distributions, higher = more uniform
  epsilon: 0.01     # Higher = more smoothing, prevents extreme values
```

#### 5. **Standard Purchase Intent Question**
Added the standard consumer research question for purchase likelihood, per best practices:
- "Thinking about your current situation and budget, how likely would you be to actually purchase this product if it were available today?"

This complements the Sean Ellis disappointment question and provides a more complete picture of purchase behavior.

#### 6. **Survey-Style Prompts**
Questions now framed like professional consumer research surveys:
- Clear context setting ("Thank you for participating in this consumer research study")
- Natural question framing (not directive)
- Emphasis on honest opinion
- Professional formatting

### Technical Implementation

**Before (v2):**
```python
# Single reference set per dimension
interest_refs = po.DataFrame({
    "id": ["interest"] * 5,
    "sentence": ["Not interested at all", ...]
})
rater = ResponseRater(interest_refs, model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
pmfs = rater.get_response_pmfs("interest", texts, temperature=1.0, epsilon=0.01)
```

**After (v3):**
```python
# Multiple reference sets with psychometric phrasing
interest_refs = po.DataFrame({
    "id": ["set1"]*5 + ["set2"]*5 + ["set3"]*5,
    "sentence": [
        "This does not appeal to me at all", ...,  # Set 1
        "This is not at all relevant to my needs", ...,  # Set 2
        "I have no interest in this whatsoever", ...  # Set 3
    ]
})
rater = ResponseRater(interest_refs, model_name=config.ssr_embedding_model)
pmfs = rater.get_response_pmfs("mean", texts, temperature=config.ssr_temperature, epsilon=config.ssr_epsilon)
```

### Expected Improvements

Based on the paper's findings, these improvements should:
1. **Increase reliability**: Multiple reference sets reduce single-phrasing bias
2. **Better distribution matching**: Larger model captures semantic nuance more accurately
3. **Configurable tuning**: Temperature and epsilon can be optimized for specific use cases
4. **Professional alignment**: Survey-style prompts elicit more authentic responses

### Configuration Options

Users can now tune SSR behavior in `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
ssr:
  # Model choice affects semantic understanding quality
  embedding_model: "all-mpnet-base-v2"  # or "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" for faster/cheaper
  
  # Temperature controls distribution sharpness
  temperature: 1.0  # Lower (0.5) = more confident/sharp, Higher (2.0) = more uncertain
  
  # Epsilon adds smoothing to prevent extreme probability masses
  epsilon: 0.01  # Higher (0.1) = more smoothing, Lower (0.001) = sharper
```

### Validation Notes

While the paper achieved 90% test-retest reliability and KS similarity > 0.85 against 9,300 human responses, our implementation currently has no human validation. Future work could include:
- Pilot study with real consumers on selected products
- Comparison of SSR distributions to human response distributions
- Reporting of reliability metrics (test-retest, KS similarity)

However, the implementation now follows all methodological recommendations from the paper.

## Reference Sentences

The implementation uses three sets of reference sentences:

**Interest (1-5):**
1. Not interested at all
2. Slightly interested
3. Moderately interested
4. Very interested
5. Extremely interested

**Disappointment (1-5):**
1. Wouldn't care at all
2. Slightly disappointed
3. Moderately disappointed
4. Very disappointed
5. Would be devastated

**Recommendation (1-5, mapped to NPS 0-10):**
1. Definitely would not recommend (NPS 0-2)
2. Probably would not recommend (NPS 3-4)
3. Might recommend (NPS 5-6)
4. Probably would recommend (NPS 7-8)
5. Absolutely would recommend (NPS 9-10)

## Example Usage

```python
# Natural language response from persona
response = PersonaResponse(
    persona_name="Alice",
    interest_response="I'm quite interested in this, it seems useful",
    disappointment_response="I would be somewhat disappointed if it went away",
    recommendation_response="I would probably recommend it to colleagues",
    main_benefit="Solves my time management problem",
    concerns=["Price seems a bit high"]
)

# SSR converts to PMF automatically in calculate_pmf()
market_fit = market_predictor.calculate_pmf(responses)
# Result: pmf_score uses probability distributions, not binary counts
```

## Migration Notes

If upgrading from the previous version:
1. Update any code that accessed `PersonaResponse.interest_score` → use SSR PMFs instead
2. Remove references to `is_very_disappointed()`, `is_promoter()`, `is_detractor()` methods
3. Update prompts to request natural language instead of numeric ratings
4. Install new dependencies: `pip install numpy polars scipy sentence-transformers`
